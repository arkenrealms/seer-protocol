# arken/packages/seer/packages/protocol/ANALYSIS.md

## Folder purpose
- Seer protocol package exposing tRPC router composition and Seer domain module contracts.

## This run (deepest-first chunk)
- Initialized submodule content.
- Completed leaf analysis for `src/modules/oasis` and `src/modules/isles`.
- Added maintainer docs:
  - `src/README.md`, `src/ANALYSIS.md`
  - `src/modules/README.md`, `src/modules/ANALYSIS.md`
  - `src/modules/oasis/{README.md,ANALYSIS.md}`
  - `src/modules/isles/{README.md,ANALYSIS.md}`

## Protocol/test relevance
- `oasis` currently has permissive inputs (`z.any`) and stubbed procedure behavior.
- `isles` appears to have router/service coupling defects (procedures routed through Evolution service path) and extensive commented legacy code.
- Root router composes many node+seer routers, so module-level contract gaps can propagate widely.

## Next chunk
- Deepest-first: `src/modules/infinite` leaf analysis/docs, then bubble up with protocol test recommendations.
- After module leaf passes, add/expand test coverage for malformed payload and auth boundary paths.
